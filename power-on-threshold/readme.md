This script requires a container (chest, barrel...) and a redstone connection on computer's back.

It will check if there is a full stack of any item in the container, and if so, it turns on the redstone connection. If there are no full stacks, redstone connection is turned off.

This is useful if you want to limit a container to one slot, which - in turn - is useful to ensure a pipeline's output is not too large. In my case it was to ensure a crafter does not eat up all my iron ingots making iron nuggets.
