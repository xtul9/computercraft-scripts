This script is intended to be used with a chest and a hopper connected.

It ensures the last 5 slots of a connected chest will be moved to a hopper. This is useful when you want to prevent certain items from overwhelming the rest your pipeline, particularly when the hopper is connected to a trash block (or anything else that gets rid of items forever).
